## Configuration reference

This document describes the YAML configuration format for `feedly-entries-processor`.

Configuration is written in YAML. Each rule has a `name`, a `source`, a `condition` block, and an `action` block.

The `source` controls where entries are fetched from:

- `saved` for saved entries
- `all` for the All feed (`global.all`)

### Conditions

Each rule has a condition that determines whether it matches a given entry.

Available condition types:

| Name                | Description                         | Parameters                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `match_all`         | Matches all entries                 | None                          |
| `stream_id_in_list` | Matches entries in given stream IDs | `stream_ids`: list of strings |

### Actions

Each rule has an action that is executed when the condition matches.

Available action types:

| Name                    | Description                                        | Parameters                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `log`                   | Logs entry details                                 | `level`: `info`, `debug`, `warning`, or `error`           |
| `add_todoist_task`      | Adds entry as a task in Todoist                    | `project_id` (required), `due_string`, `priority` (1–4), `labels` (list of label names) |
| `remove_from_feedly_tag` | Removes entry from a Feedly tag (e.g. saved). **There is no undo.** | `tag` (required) |
| `run_in_sequence`       | Runs multiple actions in sequence; stops on first failure | `actions`: list of action objects                        |

When using the `add_todoist_task` action, set the `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` environment variable (or add it to a `.env` file).

For `remove_from_feedly_tag`, set `tag` to `"global.saved"` for the built-in saved list, or to a tag label (e.g. `tech`) for user-created tags. The Feedly token directory is read from the `FEEDLY_TOKEN_DIR` environment variable (default: `~/.config/feedly`), as with other Feedly usage.
